# [BwareLabs] Monitoring solution for Moonbeam collator

## ![alt text](/docs/BWARE-icon.png) IMPORTANT NOTICE
**The scripts were tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS machines which respect the hardware requirements imposed by Moonbeam as seen [here](https://docs.moonbeam.network/node-operators/networks/full-node/#requirements).**

## ![alt text](/docs/BWARE-icon.png) Contents of the main directory
- _.env_ - this contains important environment variables which are needed in order to properly deploy the monitoring solution
  - **SLACK_API_URL** - webhook URL for your Slack channel (this will be adapted in the future for other communication channels)
- _start_alertmanager.sh_ - installs Alertmanager and configures its service
- _start_blackbox_exporter.sh_ - installs Blackbox Exporter and configures its service
- _start_prometheus.sh_ - installs Prometheus and configures its service
- _start_instrumentation.sh_ - starts all the aforementioned tools, spinning the monitoring solution up
- _config_ - directory which contains .yml/.yaml files for configuring the aforementioned tools
- _setup_ - directory which contains helper scripts for installing the aforementioned tools

## ![alt text](/docs/BWARE-icon.png) Contents of config directory
- _alert-rules.yaml_ - rules for alerting (this will be triggered in case something wrong happens and will be sent to the Slack channel mentioned in _alertmanager.yml_)
- _alertmanager.yml_ - Alertmanager configuration which contains the slack_api_url and the receiver channels (**IMPORTANT: YOU SHOULD HAVE THE CHANNELS MENTIONED HERE ALREADY CREATED IN SLACK**)
- _blackbox.yml_ - Blackbox Exporter configuration (default settings should be enough - used for RPC calls)
- _prometheus.yml_ - Prometheus configuration (default settings should be enough if using standard Moonbeam installation)

## ![alt text](/docs/BWARE-icon.png) Contents of setup directory
- _install_alertmanager.sh_ - downloads & installs Alertmanager binaries
- _install_blackbox_exporter.sh_ - downloads & installs Blackbox Exporter binaries
- _install_prometheus.sh_ - downloads & installs Prometheus binaries

## ![alt text](/docs/BWARE-icon.png) First steps
- Make sure you have git installed on your machine (if not sure, you can run the following command to make sure you have the package installed)
```
sudo apt install git -y 
```
- Clone the git main git repository via HTTPS or SSH (below example is with HTTPS since it's easier, but it is not the recommended way)
```
git clone https://github.com/bwarelabs/moonbeam-launch.git
```

## ![alt text](/docs/BWARE-icon.png) How to deploy the monitoring solution
- Go to moonbeam-launch/prometheus directory
```
cd moonbeam-launch/prometheus
```
- Carefully complete _.env_ with the appropiate values, depending on your use case
- From the _prometheus_ directory, run the following command in your terminal:
```
sudo bash start_instrumentation.sh
```
- This can be run as root or any other user with sudo privileges
- Check if everything has run correctly by accessing http://YOUR_NODE_PUBLIC_IP:9090/ - here you should be able to see the appropiate targets and alerting rules
